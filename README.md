# Mzansi Wethu

**Mzansi Wethu** is a web app that equips South African citizens with accurate, timely, and accessible information from the government. It uses visuals and simple language to explain the complex jargon often found in governance documents.

The web app also allows citizens to report issues — with a focus on infrastructure problems occurring in their communities.

## 🏆 About the Hackathon
This project was created during the **GirlCode Hackathon 2024** (Cape Town) and won **3rd place**.

At the time of the hackathon, the following features were developed:

- A functional report form for citizens to log infrastructure issues.
- A basic plan for a Services page (still in progress) that was intended to allow users to search:
  - Their respective ward and representative.
  - Local budgets, planned projects, and timelines based on their address or location.

### Planned features (not yet completed at the time):
- A news feed of local news and gazetted laws.
- A WhatsApp and SMS bot to deliver the same information via messaging platforms.

I appreciate the work and effort of my team members who contributed to this version.

## 🚀 Future Improvements (Solo Work)
I am currently working on improving and expanding the project by adding the following features on my own:

### 📢 Updates about:
- New laws and regulations.
- Important local news.
- Progress on community projects and maintenance.

### 🏛️ Information about local representatives:
- Names, contact information, and responsibilities.

### 📊 Easy-to-understand budget and project timelines:
- Visual breakdowns of planned government projects and how funds are allocated.

### 💬 WhatsApp and SMS Bot:
- Citizens will be able to access the same information via WhatsApp or SMS chatbot for easy, low-data communication.
